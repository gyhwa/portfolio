      ## Introduction
      ### Collage Challenge

      The collage challenge is to go on Unsplash or Pexels and select four random images and create a collage using those four images. Since these images are random, there is a purposeful limitation applied to the collage, which is theorized to drive creativity <a href="https://blog.ted.com/can-limitations-make-you-more-creative-a-qa-with-artist-phil-hansen/">(Source)</a>. Also, it may be clich√©, but practice makes perfect. Perhaps as I continue to practice myself, my collages will become better in the future.

      ### Tool for Collage Challenge
      I can still go onto Pexel or Unsplash and randomly pick; however, I am likely still going to be biased. I wanted to make a site that randomly selects four images for me, so that's where this project came from.

      ## Process
      ### Inspiration
      One of the sites I enjoy personally is <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>, a super fast color schemes generator. One of the aspects of the site I enjoyed was the capability to lock a particular color.

      (Fig 2: Coolors toggle lock.)

      ## Results
      ### To Do
      * Currently I am limiting the image pool to 80 images, which is causing some repeats. I need to find out what the maximum number I can put based on Pexels' curated images.
      * Request an increase in API requests I can send as currently I am limited to 200 requests per hour
