import React from "React"
import {Link} from "gatsby"
import { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';

<Container fluid>
  <div className="pad">
    <Row>
      <Col className="mt-4">
      ## Motivation
      I have been creating a few animations and am starting to learn about web development. There wasn't a centralized place to show off all my work. In addition, if I am to use it to show off my work, I can use it to place my entire CV and background to show off to others.
     </Col>
      </Row>
  </div>

      ## Process
      ### Research
      I looked into popular ways that developers are creating static sites while using ReactJS. Time and time again Gatsby kept popping up as a recommendation and seemed to be a perfect fit for what I wanted.

      I looked through the <Link to="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/">step-by-step tutorial</Link> for Gatsby to get my feet wet. From there, there was a lot of Google-ing and drawing from experiences of other languages to fill in any missing gaps.

      In terms of styling the page, Bootstrap was the ideal choice, as I used it previously with the <Link to="/project/goodmark">Goodmark</Link> project.

      ### Lessons
      In working on this porfolio, I learned about Gatsby, GraphQL, more JavaScript and more about state in React.
      ### Tools

      * <Link to="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</Link> - Static Site Generator
      * <Link to="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</Link> - Query language for APIs
      * <Link to="https://es.reactjs.org/">React</Link> - Front-End JavaScript library
      * <Link to="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">Bootstrap React</Link> - Front-End UI library

      </Row>
  </div>
</Container>

    <Row>
      <Col className="mt-4">
      ## Iterations

      ### Changes Made Over Time
      Initially, I overcomplicated the website by having separate pages for both art projects and code projects. I moved them over to the front index. In order to have the same function of having separate pages, I added a button group to filter based on project tags.

      Another design choice that was changed, was initially the CV was below the hero container instead of the projects. This created an extremely boring front page as it was quite a bit of text.

      ### To Do
