      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>While working on projects, I always want to have a style guide in place, which means including a small subset of colors I am allowed to work within. Sometimes, I find two colors I really like, but I want to find a color in between that works. In these cases, I usually go to <Link to="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe Color</Link> or to <Link to="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</Link>. Occasionally, I do not find the color I want so I wanted a tool that finds a gradient step between known colors.</p>
