      ## Research
      ### The Challenge
      When trying to save a website cross-device, current methods are clunky.

      ### The Goal
      A site to store all your bookmarks on a single page that can be accessible anywhere.

      The high level goals were to:
        * Make it fast and easy to used
        * Create an organized view
        * Allow for personal storage of bookmarks per user



      ### The User
      The main user audience for this site was myself, which made insight gathering easy.
