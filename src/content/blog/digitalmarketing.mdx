      ## Introduction

      In this post we’re going to learn how to make a beautiful paid digital marketing temple. In order to build this temple, we’ll go over the all-important marketing funnel and the four pillars of digital marketing (data, targeting, bids, and creative/landing page).

      We’ll also go over - at a high level - platforms that are most used in digital marketing and the metrics often used to discuss the performance of those platforms. In the future, there will be a separate post going into these platforms and metrics more in depth. To tie it all off, we’ll end on a few last considerations to look into when looking at your digital marketing strategy.

      ### The Most Important Blueprint: Funnel
      Before we start, everything discussed in this post will come back to this one centralized idea of a marketing funnel that each user will journey through.

      As with a real kitchen funnel, the rate at which some users go through each funnel is almost instantaneous. In other cases, some users need some encouragement, which is where paid digital marketing comes in.

      ## Pillars of Paid Digital Marketing
      The product itself is the foundation of this digital marketing temple. Even if our foundation is strong, we cannot move directly to decorating the interior as we need to build the pillars. The pillars are the components of the paid digital marketing strategy.


      ### Data
      For the first pillar, if there was the one pillar to rule them all, data would be it. This is also the area that makes traditional marketing the pug to the digital marketing greyhound, as data is more instantaneous and the more precise nature in comparison.

      One of the reasons why it is more precise and instantaneous is due to pixels. What are pixels? Pixels are snippets of code that allow you to store valuable information about the users who triggered the code and send that information to ad platforms to utilize. They can track where a user is within the funnel, including if the user has accomplished the final goal of a conversion, based on interactions with the website.

      With this information, the data from the pixel is not just important in analyzing whether a marketing campaign was successful or not, but also important in building audiences in relation to the funnel. This is a key part in the digital marketing strategy.

      Other data in relation to the funnel that’s useful in building audiences is the data that users directly provide to you through newsletter signups, account creations, or other lead forms, which shows a high level of intent. When gathering this data, you should make sure there is a unique identifier for the user; most often an email address is used.

      Before we end talking about this pillar, there is one elephant in the room that needs to be discussed. That matter is privacy. In order to be conscious of data privacy, privacy laws must be followed where applicable and allow users the option to opt out.
      ### Targeting
      With the first pillar discussed, we can move on to the second pillar: targeting. Targeting can be both used to exclude or include audiences within a campaign. I like to group targeting into two separate groups: universal and funnel specific.

      For universal targeting, the levers you can pull are about your product in general and can be applied regardless of where a user is within the funnel. The most significant targeting are:
      * Geographic Targeting
        * Even if you are only within a specific country, there can be states, provinces, cities that have higher success

      * Device
        * This can also be considered a funnel specific target; however, research has shown that mobile usage is actually universal within the purchase cycle, according to <Link to="https://marketingland.com/think-smartphones-just-bottom-funnel-think-189430">
         Marketing Land
        </Link>
      * Ad Platform Placement
        * Depending on the ad platform, there are different placements that they can serve.


      <img width="50%" src="https://www.disruptivestatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/geo-targeting-blog-1.jpg" alt="original" />

      For funnel specific, the levers utilized exist within the silos of the funnels. As a result, we’ll discuss them within each funnel state.

      Remembering back to the funnel, of the five funnel states, the first state is awareness. Within awareness, we actually don’t know much about the user, as they haven’t landed on the website for the pixel to get any data about the user. We do, however, have “data” on our product itself, which can help narrow down the pool. In addition, many platforms have information about their users that they use to optimize the campaigns themselves (sometimes even better than ourselves who knows the product the most).

      In summary:
      * Broad
        * The ad platforms themselves can optimize for users who are more likely to become aware and consider a product
      * Interest
        * These can be defined by keywords or lists of interest that the ad platform curates


      Once a user has passed the awareness state and then successfully moved into consideration, if we have a pixel or any other way to provide that data connection between the user, the website, and the ad platform, we can move into retargeting.
      * Website behavior - Page Visit (pixel)


      The third layer of the funnel are users who have shown intent by interacting with the website in one way or another and are one layer away from conversions. Interaction with this layer is again due to pixels and user provided data:
      * Website Behavior (pixel)
        * A great example are users who interacted with the cart, but abandoned the journey.
      * Email Custom Audience
        *If a user provides their email (or other information) and allows the use of it in marketing, this shows a high level of intent. We can then provide this information to the ad platforms, which can map it to their list of users.


      The funnel and audience combination often guide campaign structures within each platform.

      ### Bids & Buys
      Moving to the third pillar, we enter the world where we actually place an order for the ad placements based on the targeting we set and based on the data we currently have. In order to place ads based on the targeting, there are two methods: direct buys and auction buys.

      In an auction buy, advertisers trying to buy the same placement are pitted against each other based on their bid. The highest bidder wins...sometimes. There are a few nuances and it’s usually centered around the fact that the ad platforms themselves need to have a strong foundation - a strong product. In order to ensure they maintain a level of quality, there are benefits that the ad platforms give to ads that show high relevance with their creative and/or landing page. There are some other quality metrics that ad platforms look into as well, such as site speed and more.

      There’s another layer of complexity, as there are different bidding solutions. The main three are Cost per Click (CPC), Cost per Acquisition (CPA), and Cost per Thousand Impression (CPM). Using CPA bids typically means less control and more automation. If the ad platform's machine learning is trustworthy, this also typically means that it is likely the most efficient in getting the goal conversion. CPM is great in increasing awareness with a high level of reach and impressions, but definitely less effective in getting a cheap cost per acquisition. In the middle there is CPC, which allows you to control how you are spending. Since you’re paying based on clicks, there is at least a layer of intent that you are paying for.

      With direct buys, the purchase is made usually directly with the website (publisher). Typically this is made with a set budget and you should receive a goal CPM. The benefits of this type of buy means you are not going to be competing for a placement and guaranteed placement; however, this does mean that you are committed to a single bulk purchase, which reduces the flexibility of your budget.

      If there’s any confusion on the jargon, fear not, as we’ll be going over some of the terms later on in this post.


      ### Creative & Landing Page
      Creative - ad image and ad copy - is important in all stages of the funnel and the landing page is key in the consideration and future steps of the funnel.

      For best practice, keep the creative and landing pages pertinent to where a user is within the funnel and related to the targeting used to lead them there.

      Other best practices is to make it clear what a user should do with clear Call to Action.

      ## Ad Platforms
      These pillars can be utilized in any ad platform. In order go in depth as much as we did in the pillars, there would be too much to cover, so we’ll approach this section at a more
      ### The Big Two
      Facebook and Google are the two strong arms of respectively paid social and paid search. “Together they capture just under 70% of all digital ad dollars spent according to eMarketer” according to Marketing Land.

      ### Mobile
      Within the mobile realm, Facebook and Google both have app campaign capabilities. In addition if you have an iOS application, Apple also has their own ad platform to sponsor your app.

      Other platforms could also include Applovin, Tapjoy, and IronSource.

      ### The Others
      The other search platform that could is Bing. Bing typically has an audience that skews older than Google. Other social platforms that could be useful outside of Facebook for paid social are Reddit, Twitter, Snapchat, and Tiktok.

      If one has a more B2B product, LinkedIn also has a great ad platform that can be utilized to get quality leads. In the remarketing world, we can also explore other programmatic platforms such as AdRoll or look into platforms like Criteo.

      ## Metrics
      In this section, I’ll cover the definitions of each metric and how they interact with each.

      <img width="50%" src={'../../images/digitalmarketing/Metric-Flow.jpg'} alt="original" />
      (Fig 3: Flow of volume based metrics)

      **Impressions:** Number times the ad is rendered/viewed on a screen to a user.

      **Reach:** Number of unique users who saw an ad.

      **Click:** Number of clicks on an ad. (Unique Clicks de-duplicates users)

      **Conversion:** Number of completed desired goal. This can be tied to the click, impression/view or both.

      **View-Through Conversion:** Number of completed desired goal tied to the view but did not click.

      **Life-time Value (LTV):** Total amount of revenue a customer is expected to provide during their lifetime.


      **Frequency:** Average number of times an ad was seen by a user. *Calculation: Impressions ÷ Reach*

      **Click Through Rate (CTR):** Rate at which users click a view ad. Often used to determine effectiveness of ad copy and ad assets. *Calculation: Clicks ÷ Impressions*

      **Conversion Rate (CVR):** Rate at which users complete a conversion per landing page visit from an ad. Often used to determine effectiveness of audience quality, website design, and more. *Calculation: Conversions ÷ Clicks*

      **Average Order Value (AOV):** The average value of an order *Calculation: Revenue ÷ Conversions*

      **Cost per Acquisition (CPA):** Cost to acquire a user. If we did not account for LTV, this amount should not exceed AOV in order to make a profit. *Calculation: Cost ÷ Conversions*

      **Cost Per Click (CPC):** Price you actually pay per click. *Calculation: Cost ÷ Clicks*

      **Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM):** Price to acquire a thousand impressions. *Calculation: Cost ÷ Impression x 1000*

      **Revenue On Ad Spend (ROAS):** Measure revenue per amount spent on an ad. A value of 1 would be the equivalent of breaking even. *Calculation: Revenue ÷ Cost*

      **Return on Investment (ROI):** Measures profit attributable to marketing. *Calculation: Revenue ÷ Cost - 1*

      **Ad Yield:** This is a non-traditional term. It is used to determine if the ad copy or image asset had an effect further down the line with relation to the landing page *Calculation: Conversions ÷ Impression*

      ## Uncontrollable
      Everything we’ve discussed is controllable by the advertiser. There are ways to minimize the impact or even it to use your advantage, but there are three parts that aren’t controlled directly. Those are: seasonality, competitors, and volatility.
      ### Seasonality
      Within each industry there are different seasonal impacts to your advertising. For ecommerce, for example, conversion rates typically increase close to the holiday; however, at the same time cost per clicks or cost per impressions increase in the Quarter 4. For B2B, this behavior is oftentimes shifted to Quarter 1.

      We can also consider weekly seasonality since people often see spikes on Sunday and Monday for B2B as potential customers get reminded by the start of the work week. There’s an even a layer deeper with hour to hour seasonality based on lunch breaks and post/pre work hours.

      To go the opposite end in terms of scale, there are events that occur yearly or quadrennially. An example of this is the current 2020 election cycle here in the U.S., which brings increasing cost per clicks and cost per impressions.

      No matter what level, the important part is to analyze your own unique sales data to find these trends.


      ### Competitors
      While we may wish we could control our competitors actions in our dreams, the truth of the matter is we cannot. Occasionally, perhaps the competitor may have an increase in budget and have the capabilities to bid harder on the auction. This in turn will increase your cost per click. Occasionally, the opposite can occur; decreasing your cost per click.

      ### Elasticity
      Investopedia defines elasticity as “In business and economics, elasticity refers to the degree to which individuals, consumers or producers change their demand or the amount supplied in response to price or income changes.” <Link to="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elasticity.asp#:~:text=In%20business%20and%20economics%2C%20elasticity,a%20good%20or%20service's%20price"> Source </Link>

      In marketing, there could be changes in marketing behavior due to the macroeconomics of the world.
