      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Are we aligned with a single Northstar goal?</li>
        <li>What is this Northstar goal? </li>
        <li>Are we hitting this Northstar goal? </li>
        <li>Are there any other goals that correlate to the Northstar goal? Example: Account Creation </li>
        <li>Do we have the pixels and events in place to track these goals? </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deeper Dive</h3>
      In discussing the progress of reaching the goal(s), these questions can be useful to ask to go more in depth. If any of the acronyms are not familiar, I recommend reading my <Link to="https://gyhwa.github.io/portfolio/blog/digitalmarketing/">Paid Digital Marketing 101</Link> article.
