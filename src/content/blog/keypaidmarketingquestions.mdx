      ## Questions
      ### General
      * Are we aligned with a single Northstar goal?
      * What is this Northstar goal?
      * Are we hitting this Northstar goal?
      * Are there any other goals that correlate to the Northstar goal? Example: Account Creation
      * Do we have the pixels and events in place to track these goals?


      ### Deeper Dive
      In discussing the progress of reaching the goal(s), these questions can be useful to ask to go more in depth. If any of the acronyms are not familiar, I recommend reading my <Link to="https://gyhwa.github.io/portfolio/blog/digitalmarketing/">Paid Digital Marketing 101</Link> article.

      * What A/B tests are we running for our landing page?
        * What is our bounce rate on our landing page?

        * Where on the site’s funnel are customers abandoning?
      * Do we have a budget to test a new ad platform?
        * Do we need to increase more customers entering our marketing funnel?
        * Do we already have customers in the marketing funnel, but need to improve getting customers to convert?
        * Do we have better performance on mobile or desktop? Or are we device agnostic?
