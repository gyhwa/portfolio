      ## Introduction

      There are some popular sites on here, but maybe there will be something new for you. Hopefully, these will be as useful for you as they have been for me.

      ## Marketing
      We’ll start off with some websites that I use in my job that are free to use.

      ### Answer the Public
      https://answerthepublic.com/

      “AnswerThePublic listens into autocomplete data from search engines like Google then quickly cranks out every useful phrase and question people are asking around your keyword.” It’s useful for brainstorming content ideas, getting customer insights, and farming keywords for your paid search campaigns.

      ### Moat
      https://moat.com/

      Facebook, through their Page Insights, shows what other advertisers are running for their creatives. How do you get this information for display ads on other platforms? Answer: Use Moat.

      ### SpyFu
      https://www.spyfu.com/

      Technically, the more in-depth information is locked in a paid product; however, even with the free product, there are some interesting uses. For example, you can find competitors and how many keywords overlap with these competitors.

      ## Design
      I’m not a designer, but these websites offset what I do not know.

      ### Color Hunt
      https://colorhunt.co/

      Need a color scheme? Color Hunt’s got your back to provide you your choice of hand-picked trendy, popular and fresh new color palettes. Each color palette comes with four colors - one primary color, a secondary color, and three additional colors. There are hex codes for each color and each color scheme is exportable as a PNG file.


      ### The Noun Project
      https://thenounproject.com/

      Thousands and thousands of icons at the power of your hand. All of the icons are under the Creative Commons license for free, so you will have to provide credit. But that’s a small price to pay for access to thousands and thousands of amazing icons. There is also a paid royalty-free license at $2.99 per each icon if needed.


      ### Font Awesome
      https://fontawesome.com/

      On the end of web development, Font Awesome has your back with over 1,500 free icons to use. It’s CDN powered kits making it easy to “make changes without ever pushing code or managing files.” Beautiful.


      ### Pexels
      https://www.pexels.com/
      There’s several free to use image sources (a great alternative is Unsplash), but Pexels is my favorite. They have even expanded to creating new videos. If you want to even, you can use their API for your own web development project.


      ### Lorem Picsum
      https://picsum.photos/
      Just imagine famous Lorem Ipsum, but for images. As much as using the same cute cat is great, sometimes you just want something different per image.
